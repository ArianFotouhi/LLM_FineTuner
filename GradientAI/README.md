# This method leverages Gradient library 

## This pipeline requires to sign up in [gradient.ai](https://gradient.ai/) and receive workspace id as well as access key. 
## A noticeable benefit of this pipeline is developer can simply create its own dataset according to the code format and fine tune the model on it. 
## The avilable LLMs for gradient.ai are: 

#### 1.bloom-560m
#### 2.llama2-7b-chat
#### 3.nous-hermes2

We have selected 'nous-hermes2' that is a fine tuned version of llama2 and then we fine tuned the model on our custom dataset.
