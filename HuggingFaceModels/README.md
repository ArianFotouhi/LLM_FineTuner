# Code explanation 
## Imports and Setup:

The notebook starts with !nvidia-smi that is a command used to display information about the available GPU (if any) in the Colab environment.
A series of !pip install commands follow, installing specific versions of various Python packages, including torch, transformers, datasets, peft, bitsandbytes, and trl.

## Imports and Data Loading:

The notebook then imports several Python libraries, including json, re, pprint, pandas, torch, and various modules from Hugging Face's datasets and transformers.
The notebook loads a dataset named "TweetSumm" from Salesforce's Dialog Studio using the Hugging Face datasets library.

## Data Processing:

There are functions defined for processing and cleaning text data. The generate_training_prompt function creates training prompts for a conversational summarization task.
The generate_text function generates training examples from the loaded dataset.
The process_dataset function applies these text processing functions to the training and validation datasets.

## Model Creation:
The create_model_and_tokenizer function is responsible for initializing both the language model and the tokenizer.
The BitsAndBytesConfig is used to configure quantization settings for model optimization, enabling the use of 4-bit quantization.
The language model (model) is loaded from the pretrained model specified by MODEL_NAME.
Various configurations, such as using SafeTensors for numerical stability, applying quantization, trusting remote code during loading, and automatic device mapping, are set during model initialization.
The tokenizer (tokenizer) is loaded from the same pretrained model.
Special token settings are adjusted, including setting the padding token to the end-of-sequence token (eos_token) and specifying padding on the right side.

## Training Setup:
The TrainingArguments object is created to specify various settings for training.
Parameters include batch size, gradient accumulation steps, optimizer choice (paged_adamw_32bit), logging steps, learning rate, mixed-precision training (fp16), maximum gradient norm, number of training epochs, evaluation strategy, evaluation steps, warm-up ratio, save strategy, grouping by sequence length, output directory, reporting to TensorBoard, saving SafeTensors during training, learning rate scheduler type, and a seed for reproducibility.


## Model Training:
An instance of the SFTTrainer is created, taking the language model (model), training dataset (dataset["train"]), validation dataset (dataset["validation"]), PEFT (Posterior Estimation Fine-Tuning) configuration (peft_config), dataset text field ("text"), maximum sequence length, tokenizer, training arguments (args), etc.
The train method is called on the trainer to initiate the training process.

## Model Saving:
After training, the save_model method is called on the trainer to save the trained model to the specified output directory (OUTPUT_DIR).

## Fine-tuning Model Loading:
The fine-tuned model is loaded using AutoPeftModelForCausalLM from the pretrained model saved in the output directory (OUTPUT_DIR).
Additional settings, such as low_cpu_mem_usage, may be applied during loading.

##  Inference Setup:
The generate_prompt function is defined to create a prompt for inference based on a given conversation and a system prompt.

## Inference Examples:
An example from the test dataset is selected.
The summary and conversation for the selected example are printed.
The inference code (summarize function) is provided but commented out.

# Theory behind this code:
The libraries Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) is released to facilitate using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) in LLM finetuning. There are basically three steps in RLHF based fine tuning of LLMs:
1. Fine tune the LLM model on a downstream task
2. Prepare a human annotated dataset and train a reward model
3. Further fine-tune the LLM from step 1 with the reward model and this dataset using RL that is usually by Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm

The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library idea is to reduce the number of trainable paramters of a pretrained model with aim of reduction in computation time and cost (GPU memory). There are several advantageous techniques that can be implemented by PEFT and we are going to indicate two of them:

Adapter Layer: Intoduced from the paper [Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00751.pdf), adapters are additional neural network components inserted between layers of the pre-trained model. They're specifically trained for individual tasks and allow the model to adapt without modifying the original parameters extensively.

LORA: Originated from the paper [LORA: LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf), LORA focuses on reducing the dimensionality of the pre-trained model's parameters to enable efficient adaptation to new tasks. By leveraging low-rank approximations, LORA aims to retain the crucial information present in the parameters while significantly reducing their number, making adaptation to new tasks more computationally efficient. By reducing the rank of these weight matrices it means finding a lower-dimensional representation that captures most of the important information present in the original matrix.
